One important thing Iâ€™ve learned so far is how to effectively use GitHub for version control and collaboration. Creating repositories, working with branches, making commits, and opening pull requests has helped me understand how professional developers manage and track changes in their code. This foundational knowledge is preparing me to contribute to real-world projects and work more efficiently in team environments.
