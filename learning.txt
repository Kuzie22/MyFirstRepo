What I have learned from this course
This course has helped me understand the basics of Git and GitHub. I have learned how to initialize repositories, track changes with commits, and collaborate using branches and pull requests. I now know how to push code to remote repositories, resolve merge conflicts, and manage my project history effectively. These skills will be useful in both personal and team-based software projects.
